# Overview

I was trying to learn something new by getting out of my comfort zone a little by trying to build a simple django app

## Description
It is an app that takes a user input in this case a name of a food and the amount of calories that the food has, saves it to a data base then displays both in a table.

## How to...
To start a test server you need to open the console and type 'python manage.py runserver' then open a browser and go to localhost:8000/calorie_counter/home 

## Purpose
  To learn more about different types of development and broaden my horizons to learn something new

## Web Pages

The home page recieves information from the database and the user can input information to the database which basically mean the user can write to the screen. The about page is pretty static but it is using djangos content block syntax which is pretty cool.
{Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.}

## Development Environment

I used vscode ,python 3 and django framework


## Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}
* [StackOverflow]https://stackoverflow.com/
* [Django Reference]https://www.djangoproject.com/

## Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add a total to the bottom of the list
* Make the interface look better
* Add more info to the table like dates and macros maybe
