# Overview

This is something I made using the ArcGIS APi. First you search for an area you want to look in. Then you can click on the drop down to search for points of interest such 
as restaurants, gas stations, and parks. 

## Purpose
The purpose of writing this software was to broaden my horizons and learn something new as I am trying to find internships.
