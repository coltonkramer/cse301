The purpose of this project was to learn something new on my own. I chose to learn a little bit about Java.
I built a simple currency converter that runs in the command line. I look into creating an interface for it but with the time given
for the project, it seemed a little ambitious.

The program will take a currency code ex. USD and convert it into a currency of your choosing. To eliminate hard coding every conversion
I simply use a switch block to convert everything to USD then a following switch block that converts it into the final currency. 

Thank you for taking a look at my work!
